### A WebAssembly front-end for Cycle

Omega is a simple interpreter for the cycle library and language. It supports a subset of expressions that will be documented as soon as possible.
It is mainly useful as a demonstration for both WebAssembly builds and cycle's features.

## Getting started

To use omega, you will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning, a modern [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) version with [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/) for the compilation and [wasm-bindgen](https://crates.io/crates/wasm-bindgen) to interact with WebAssembly,
```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/hrkz/omega && cd omega

# Start the compilation, download dependencies and link with wasm-bindgen
$ cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
$ wasm-bindgen --target web target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/omega.wasm --out-dir web/pkg/
```
For more details about WebAssembly with Rust, refer to the [book](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/).
